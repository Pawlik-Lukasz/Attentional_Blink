# Psychopy Experiment

This is a Python experiment built using Psychopy, a library for creating psychology stimuli in Python.

## Overview

This experiment presents participants with a series of letters displayed on the screen for brief durations. Participants are asked to remember specific letters and recall them at the end of each trial. The experiment measures memory recall accuracy under controlled conditions and checks phenomenon called attentional blink, which occurs when trying to remember symbols after symbol in contrasting color.
